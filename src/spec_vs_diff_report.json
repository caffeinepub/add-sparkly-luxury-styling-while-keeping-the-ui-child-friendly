However, the required generated sparkle image assets are not shown as added under frontend/public/assets/generated, and the diff summary suggests additional non-styling feature work in Homework/Timetable/Scene context that was not requested.",

      "reason": "SparkleOverlay references the required image paths, but the diff does not show any new image files added under frontend/public/assets/generated (only TS/TSX/CSS/config changes are shown). Without the actual assets being added, REQ-4 is not fully implemented.",
